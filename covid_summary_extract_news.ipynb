              "['Dublin, The “Swine Healthcare Market – Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 – 2024)” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.\\nThe global swine health market is expected to register a healthy CAGR during the forecast period, owing to the increasing incidence of swine diseases.\\nChina Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its first African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province in 2018, 145 ASF outbreaks detected in 32 Provinces/Autonomous Regions/Municipalities/Special Administrative Region. More than 1,160,000 pigs have been rising investments in R&D activities in the development of novel therapeutics, a growing number of governments initiatives for the prevention of zoonotic diseases, increasing demand for livestock products is expected to propel the global swine health market. culled in an effort to halt the further spread. Additionally, the growing consumption of pork globally.\\nKey Market Trends\\nVaccines are Expected to Lead the Market\\nVaccines are comprised of viruses, bacteria or other disease-causing organisms that have been killed or altered. Hence, they cannot cause any disease and boost up immunity. New advanced vaccines have been manufactured, which contains genetically engineered components derived from those disease agents. They are given to pigs, usually by injection, to stimulate an immune response which will protect the pigs against later natural infection with the organism from which the vaccine was derived.\\nMost of the vaccines stimulate both a humoral response and a cell-mediated response. Vaccines can be live, containing living organisms which will multiply in the pig, or inactivated, containing only killed organisms which will not multiply in the pig. As there is a need for novel vaccines against all the disease-causing pathogens, there is a rapid increase in the R&D expenditure, which drives the vaccine segment to expand its reach to a broad spectrum of diseases.\\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate over the Forecast Period\\nNorth America is expected to dominate the market due to the rising incidence of swine infections, such as Swine Enteric Coronavirus Diseases (SECD), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDv), porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), which has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.\\nThe virus is endemic in swine populations in North America. In the United States, the Swine Health Protection Act (SHPA) regulates the meat products fed to swine. Compliance with this act ensures that all food waste fed to swine is properly treated to kill disease organisms. Raw meat may transmit numerous infectious or communicable diseases to swine. Over the forecast period, with the rise in the incidence of swine, the US is expected to be a major revenue-generating region for the swine health market.\\nCompetitive Landscape\\nThe market players in the swine health market are involving in various growth strategies such as collaborations, partnerships, agreements, mergers, and acquisitions in order to enhance the market presence. For instance, in 2018 Elanco Animal Health, introduced Prevacent PRRS a modified-live respiratory vaccine for reduction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), respiratory form, in piglets two weeks or older. In May 2019, MSD Animal Health has launched its Porcilis Ery+Parvo+Lepto combination vaccine for pigs.\\nKey Topics Covered\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Study Deliverables\\n1.2 Study Assumptions\\n1.3 Scope of the Study\\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\\n4.1 Market Overview\\n4.2 Market Drivers\\n4.2.1 Increasing Incidence of Swine Diseases\\n4.2.2 Increasing Demand for Livestock Products\\n4.2.3 Increasing Investments in R&D Activities to Develop Novel Therapeutics\\n4.3 Market Restraints\\n4.3.1 Regulatory Challenges\\n4.3.2 High Cost Associated With Swine Health Especially in the Developing Countries\\n4.4 Porter’s Five Force Analysis\\n4.4.1 Threat of New Entrants\\n4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers\\n4.4.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers\\n4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products\\n4.4.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry\\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\\n5.1 By Products\\n5.1.1 Diagnostic Tests\\n5.1.1.1 Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA)\\n5.1.1.2 Rapid Immuno Migration (RIM)\\n5.1.1.3 Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion (AGID)\\n5.1.1.4 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\\n5.1.1.5 Diagnostic Imaging\\n5.1.2 Therapeutics\\n5.1.2.1 Vaccines\\n5.1.2.2 Parasiticide\\n5.1.2.3 Anti-infective\\n5.1.2.4 Feed additives\\n5.1.2.5 Antibiotics\\n5.1.2.6 Others\\n5.2 By Diseases\\n5.2.1 Exudative dermatitis (greasy pig disease)\\n5.2.2 Coccidiosis\\n5.2.3 Respiratory diseases\\n5.2.4 Swine dysentery\\n5.2.5 Porcine parvovirus\\n5.2.6 Others\\n5.3 Geography\\n5.3.1 North America\\n5.3.2 Europe\\n5.3.3 Asia-Pacific\\n5.3.4 Middle East & Africa\\n5.3.5 South America\\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\\n6.1 Company Profiles\\n6.1.1 Abaxis\\n6.1.2 Bayer Animal Health\\n6.1.3 Boehringer Ingelheim\\n6.1.4 Ceva Animal Health Inc.\\n6.1.5 Elanco\\n6.1.6 IDVet\\n6.1.7 Merck Animal Health\\n6.1.8 Merial\\n6.1.9 Vetoquinol S.A.\\n6.1.10 Virbac\\n6.1.11 Zoetis Animal Healthcare\\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/shhuje\\nResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.\\nCONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\\n ',\n",
